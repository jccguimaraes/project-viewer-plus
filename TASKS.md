# Tasks

## on-progress

## todo

- [Expand / Collapse] Remove expand / collapse configuration from the file and pass it to the atom serialization process.
- [Update] Current implementation is not very performant friendly.
- [Drag'n'Drop] Dropping (ex: tree-view) catches the drop.
- [Gist] Refactor all logic to be more compact.
- [Selected project] Every time that an update is done, the selected project is wipped (add state?).
- [Context Switcher] [Packages] Currently `find-and-replace` needs to loose focus to be able to find again in current project using only the keyboard (pressing `Find All` button works perfect);
- [Context Switcher] [Packages] Validate if any more core packages need to be added
- [Documentation] Don't fall behind on it!
- [Unit tests] Don't fall behind on it!
- [All-Contributors] Find out why README gets messed
- [Async / Promises] Consider changing `new Promise...` to `async / try catch`.
- [Editor / Icon] Hover sometimes does not remove the tooltip
- [SelectList] Find a way to clear the input
