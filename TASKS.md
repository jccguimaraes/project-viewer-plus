# Tasks

### Database

##### Expand / Collapse (*in-progress*)

- Remove expand / collapse configuration from the file and pass it to the atom serialization process.

##### Update (*in-progress*)

- Current implementation is not very performant friendly

##### Selected project (*in-progress*)

- Every time that an update is done, the selected project is whipped (add state?).

### Context Switcher

##### Packages (*in-progress*)

- Currently `find-and-replace` needs to loose focus to be able to find again in current project using only the keyboard (pressing `Find All` button works perfect);
- Validate if any more core packages need to be added
