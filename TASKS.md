# Tasks

### Database

##### Unsaved state (*in-progress*)

- For some reason this is not working when switching projects.

##### Expand / Collapse (*todo*)

- Remove expand / collapse configuration from the file and pass it to the atom serialization process.

##### Update (*todo*)

- Current implementation is not very performant friendly.

##### Drag'n'Drop

- Dropping (ex: tree-view) catches the drop.

##### Gist (*todo*)

- Refactor all logic to be more compact.

##### Selected project (*todo*)

- Every time that an update is done, the selected project is wipped (add state?).

### Context Switcher

##### Packages (*todo*)

- Currently `find-and-replace` needs to loose focus to be able to find again in current project using only the keyboard (pressing `Find All` button works perfect);
- Validate if any more core packages need to be added

### Documentation (*todo*)

- Don't fall behind on it!

### Unit tests (*todo*)

- Don't fall behind on it!

### All-Contributors (*todo*)

- Find out why README gets messed
