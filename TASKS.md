# Tasks

### Database

##### File (*todo*)

- Validate when no file exists;
- Create on no file detected;
- Convert old file to new one

##### Expand / Collapse (*todo*)

- Remove expand / collapse configuration from the file and pass it to the atom serialisation process.

##### Update (*todo*)

- Current implementation is not very performant friendly.

##### Gist (*todo*)

- Refactor all logic to be more compact.

##### Selected project (*todo*)

- Every time that an update is done, the selected project is whipped (add state?).

### Context Switcher

##### Packages (*in-progress*)

- Currently `find-and-replace` needs to loose focus to be able to find again in current project using only the keyboard (pressing `Find All` button works perfect);
- Validate if any more core packages need to be added
